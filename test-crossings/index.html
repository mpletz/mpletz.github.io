<h2>Chapter 2: Modeling rolling contact fatigue in crossing noses</h2>

<p>In the railway track, turnouts (also called points or switches) let the train switch from one track to another. They are therefore a key part of the track structure, particularly close to and at railway stations. The crossings consist of a switch panel (where the switch rails guide the train either on one or the other track) and a crossing panel, where the inner rails of the two tracks cross each other. There are three crossing solutions where a) the wheel flange just runs over the continuous rails that are in the way, b) the wheel flange runs through slits in the fixed rails, dividing the rails into a crossing nose (or frog) and two wing rails, or c) the setup is similar to (b), but with a movable crossing nose or movable wing rails to obtain a continuous running surface. A fixed crossing panel (b) with its wing rails and crossing nose is shown in Fig. 1a. </p>

<p>As one wheelset of a train runs over the fixed crossing, the contact position on the wheel profile laterally changes. facing/trailing move (those words are used by @kassa-2008). facing run, as illustrated in Fig. 1: typical intermediate position on the regular rail (point A in Fig. 1) . then shifted away from flange in the diverging wing rail (towards point B). Impact on the crossing nose close to the wheel flange (point C). As continues to run, the lateral contact position shift backwards to point A. trailing route: the same procedure, but backwards. </p>

<p>conical running surface —&gt; vertical movement of wheel. Impact on crossing nose (facing move) or on one wing rail (trailing route). Also some slip because of the misfit in the rolling radius: first the rotational velocity of the wheelset may increase as the lateral contact position shifts away from the flange, and as it runs onto the crossing at a lager rolling radius, the wheel rotates faster than for free rolling, effectively accelerating on the crossing nose. Both in addition to possible acceleration or breaking of wheelsets.</p>

<p>Higher load for running towards crossing nose because in this case, the narrow nose leads to higher local stresses for the same impact forces, </p>

<p>with completely controlled geometry of wheel and rails: smooth transition with no vertical movement of the wheel, and therefore no impact (dynamic increase in the vertical contact force). However, due to geometric constraints, the contact area in the region of the transition is smaller than on the regular wheel. Therefore, more wear, plastic deformation, and RCF is expected. Which changes the geometry and therefore leads to a vertical movement of the wheel as it runs through a crossing, which is associated with an impact that increases the vertical contact forces and in term the contact stresses.</p>

<p>—&gt; failure in crossings @grossoni-2021</p>

<p>Models on this impact: simplified as a 1d model by Fischer @fischer-2005,@fischer-2008. Or first approaches using the Multi Body System (MBS) methods: describe briefly: springs, dashpots, masses of vehicle and track, simple model for the rail bending, stack of wheel and rail profiles to obtain the contact positions in a simple analytical model @hertz-1981 or other fast model Other methods of @kalker-1991, BEM code, @toumi-2016, @vollebregt-2014, @vollebregt-2021. Possible limitations of contact models are discussed in @magalhaes-2022. Such MBS computations for turnout are presented in @andersson-1998, @kassa-2006, @kassa-2008, @alfi-2009, or for tramway turnouts @bruni-2009. </p>

<p><mark>harder to describe: plastic deformation or detailed stress fields for using stress filed-based damage laws. therefore, multi-scale models that couple detailed contact models considering plasticity to the MBS code @johansson-2011, @nicklish-2010, or FEM models with simplified vehicle-track behavior (like disregarding details of the bogies and sleepers, ballast, …) by Wiest et al. @wiest-2005 for one cycle, followed by multiple cycle models that describe the cyclic flattening of the crossing nose @wiest-2008. But why is this plastic deformation so interesting? And what role does it play. Once one can compute this plastic adaption in numerical models, one can see how to account for this plastic adaption in a simple and accurate way.</mark> showing how contact patches can be computed using different approaches @wiest-2008a accurately in explicit FEM models @zhao-2014. </p>

<h3>Plastic load redistribution in the crossing nose</h3>

<p>Repeated impact of wheels on the narrow crossing nose: plastic deformation that flattens the top and therefore increases the size of the contact surface, as described by Johnson @johnson-1989, who states that three mechanisms contribute to the shakedown process: </p>

<ol>
	<li>residual stresses through plastic deformation,</li>
	<li>strain hardening of the material, and </li>
	<li>flattening of the surfaces due to plastic deformation. </li>
</ol>

<p>—&gt; shakedown map obtained for model of cylinder running on an elastic half-space. This also reduces the contact pressure, which is associated with less wear or crack formation. Cyclic plastic material behavior. </p>

<p>Compression: this is good: cross-section increases. Hertz-contact: this is even better because the contact surface increases even more!!!</p>

<p><mark>add arrows indicating residual stresses in the figure?</mark></p>

<figure><img src="Image%2011.07.24,%2013-45.pdf" alt="The influence of plastic deformation of the crossing nose on the contact pressure: as the nose flattens at its top, the size of the contact patch increases and the contact pressure decreases."/><figcaption>The influence of plastic deformation of the crossing nose on the contact pressure: as the nose flattens at its top, the size of the contact patch increases and the contact pressure decreases.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Besides the issue that hundreds of cycles of this system need to be computed to accurately capture this “geometric shakedown” (as described in @johnson-1989), the crossing is not overrun each time by the same wheel profile. On the contrary, there can be a wide rage of worn wheel profiles, that influence the position of impact on the crossing nose. These profiles can flatten the crossing nose in different directions, which limits the reduction of contact pressure for each of these wheels.</p>

<p>The plastic deformation of a very simplified crossing nose was modeled first in an explicit FEM model by Wiest et al. @wiest-2005 for one cycle, followed by multiple cycle models that describe the cyclic flattening of the crossing nose @wiest-2008. Pletz et al. then extended the model to realistic crossing geometries including the wing rails @pletz-2012, applied this model to heavy haul applications @pletz-2012a, and compared the plastic deformations ion three very differently behaving crossing materials @pletz-2014, including an assessment of the loads on surface cracks. </p>

<p>other groups then also set up explicit FEM models to assess damage in crossings @guo-2013, @ma-2018,@ma-2023. Or @alizadeh-2022 including bigger parts of the sleepers and trackpad, and ballast in such models.

</blockquote>

<p>To study the distribution of wheel profiles and multiple load cycles in reasonable computation times, a simplified model for the impact of the wheel on the crossing nose has been developed. It introduces a wheel with a flat running surface, and reduces the crossing nose to one where the head radius and the vertical level are both defined as a function of the longitudinal coordinate <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math>. Furthermore, there are no wing rails in this simplified model. Instead, a geometrical analysis predicts the position <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math> and the angle <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>φ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\varphi</annotation></semantics></math> that the wheel impacts on the crossing nose, see Fig. 3. In this way, a range of wheel profiles can easily be modeled, and computation times can be considerably reduced. The dynamics of the wheel on the wing rail are therefore disregarded, which is a good approximation for not too big train speeds.</p>

Results of vertical impact forces and the maximum contact stresses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mention that by design, this simplified model does not account for slip introduced by the discrepancy of the rolling radius between the wheel running on the wing rail and running on the crossing nose. For the plastic deformation and the denting of the crossing nose, this slip can be disregarded. When assessing wear or surface cracking, however, it is crucial to incorporate the slip. Therefore, the model has been extended to also account for the slipping @wiedorn-2019a. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Multiple load cycles</h3>

<p> The crossing node plastically adapts to the loading in the first dozens of load cycles and then only continues to plastically deform in a very small (unwanted) extend or if completely different wheels come along. Therefore, the plastic adaption of the crossing nose to the loading can be studied with a limited number of load cycles. The simple model proposed in Paper A is taken and overrun by a) one wheel profile or b) a range of wheel profiles, which repeatedly impact onto the crossing nose, as indicated in Figure 5. If the same wheel impacts onto the crossing nose, it makes a distinctive dent in the crossing nose, which can in turn lead to increased dynamic forces. This increase in dynamic forces can increase the loads and then lead to further plastic deformation, or even to issues regarding the run of the whole train, which would require re-profiling of the crossing nose. For the varied wheel profiles, the dent is more smooth and issues with increased dynamic forces are limited. </p>

<figure><img src="Weichen-5.pdf" alt="Resulting plastic deformation in the crossing nose due to 80 passing wheels. When using only one wheel profile the impact occurs always at the same longitudinal position, with a shorter and deeper dent in the crossing nose. For varied wheel profiles, the impact positions spread in the longitudinal direction, causing a wider and flatter dent."/><figcaption>Resulting plastic deformation in the crossing nose due to 80 passing wheels. When using only one wheel profile the impact occurs always at the same longitudinal position, with a shorter and deeper dent in the crossing nose. For varied wheel profiles, the impact positions spread in the longitudinal direction, causing a wider and flatter dent.</figcaption></figure>

<p>This plastic adaption to the wheel profile spectrum, which the crossing is exposed to, contributes to the durability of the crossing. It is the reason for using high Manganese steels (also called Hadfileld steels, with a typical Manganese content of 13% @liu-2011) that initially have a small yield stress of about 300 MPa, but work harden extensively, with an increase in the yield stress of way above 1000 MPa. This means that they initially change their geometry but then tend to stabilize due to the geometric adaption, buildup of residual stresses, and hardening of the material.</p>

<p>compare different crossing materials: plastic adaptation of them. However: low yield stress materials: extensive adaptation with low contact pressure, high hardness materials: only slight adaptation: very high contact pressure. But which is more critical? The harder material of course can also withstand higher stresses!</p>

<p>Therefore, the subsurface damage parameter of Dang Van is selected in Paper B<sup><a id="ffn2" href="#fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and its parameters are calibrated for three crossing materials (manganese steel, chromium-bainitic steel, and tool steel) using cyclic experiments. This damage parameter is based on the maximum shear stress, but also takes the influence of the hydrostatic stress into account. </p>

<p>In the simplified crossing model, five characteristic wheel profiles run onto a crossing nose with the Chaboche-type elastic-plastic material models of the three materials. </p>

<h3>Issues of manganese steel for high cycle numbers</h3>

<p>Two stages can be defined in the life of a crossing nose: a) the run-in process in the first few cycles and b) the further cyclic plastic deformation of the run-in geometry, as shown in Figure 6.</p>

<ol>
	<li>In the run-in process, the plastic deformation should be large enough to reduce the stresses, but not so large that the impact forces are considerably increased. A constitutive model of the crossing material needs to accurately represent these first cycles.</li>
	<li>The further plastic deformation is more subtle: it is interesting, if there is further and further unfavorable plastic deformation over thousands of cycles. Which either needs constitutive models that can accurately account for the ratcheting of the material, or simple approaches that judge if shakedown is reached based on stresses computed in the model and the yield stress in the material. The shakedown maps are widely used to do so, which plot the maximum contact pressure divided by the shear yield stress over the creepage </li>
</ol>

<p>This plastic adaption also has three practical effects: a) the tolerances in the initial geometry are not so crucial as for high-strength steels. Indeed, it could even make sense to account for the plastic deformation and optimize the initial geometry so to obtain a preferable run-in geometry. b) If a very worn wheel profile comes along, the impact rather leads to plastic deformation and adapts to it, but c) the low initial yield stress is associated with a low hardness, which lies below the requirements regarding the track infrastructure. Since Manganese crossings are widely used, there obviously has been a solution for this too small hardness.</p>

<p>But how to increase the hardness on the running surfaces of a cast Manganese crossing? For continuous profiles, cold working such as rolling is widely used. It introduces plastic deformations and residual stresses and therefore increases the hardness. But somehow rolling a crossing may be possible, but can be very tedious considering the many different crossing geometries, and that after rolling, the crossing should have a defined geometry. So the solution that crossing manufacturers have come up with is explosive hardening: some layers of explosives are stacked on the cast crossings. During the explosion, the shock wave introduces plastic deformations in the top layer of the crossing @zhang-2010 @liu-2011, obtaining acceptable hardness. </p>

<p>Mit/Ohne: hohe Zyklen beurteilen, ob es weiter geht: genauere Aussagen nur möglich, wenn sowohl geometrischer „shakedown“ als auch material shakedown berücksichtigt werden. This has bed done in previous works (wiest) but also with the simplified crossing model, described in Paper C<sup><a id="ffn3" href="#fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>: hardness maps on cross-section: put into the model, then run over…</p>

<p><mark>(beschreiben Ergebnisse explosion hardened stuff)</mark></p>

<blockquote>
<p>(The plastic adaptation of the manganese steel is nice, but if it does not reach shakedown after some thousand cycles and continues to plastically deform, the dynamics of the process become worse. This work investigates this run-in state with a measured deformed geometry and accounting for the pre-deformation (including the hardening of the material) by using hardness measurements from which yield stresses are extracted.)</p>

Model B can show if really a steady-state has been obtained or if the crossing continues to plastically deform, causing problems in the dynamics of the transition process."/><figcaption>The two distinct regions in the life of a crossing nose of a) the first few dozens of cycles with plastic adaptation (Model A) and b) further plastic deformations at high cycle numbers where a run-in shape has been obtained (Model B).

<blockquote>
<p>How about a subsurface damage parameter (Dang-Van): how high is it for different crossing materials? And how is it affected by the plastic deformation of those materials, which of course determines the stresses that also cause the damage? Five types of wheel with ten load cycles each to obtain the adaptation which is highest in the first few cycles and then declines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dang-Van approach to predict subsurface damage @desmione-2006, @ekberg-2007 used amongst other methods for subsurface damage in wheels. Original author applied the Dang Van criterion to rails @van-2009.</p>

<p></p>

<p>But how should that model practically be used for assessing damage in crossings? What do the dynamic forces, contact pressures, and creepages, which are influenced by the run-in process, mean for wear and RCF? Answering this question has been the aim of the work in Paper D<sup><a id="ffn4" href="#fn4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>, which introduces a damage assessment toolbox and is described in the next section.</p>

<h3>The damage assessment toolbox</h3>

<p>The geometry of the crossing and the wheel are of course crucial for the contact points and dynamic forces. But as a next step, the question is how the model results can be used to assess damage. Evaluating damage variables from the following stress and strain fields in the model can be too complicated. Therefore, in Paper D we came up with up with an interface using a limited number of load parameters of the contact patch evaluated in the full FEM model that are used in an input in existing, and, at a later point, can be used in newly developed damage models.</p>

<p>These load parameters of the contact patch are the maximum contact pressure <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>p</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p_0</annotation></semantics></math>, the creepage <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c</annotation></semantics></math>, and the contact patch length <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a</annotation></semantics></math>. For the damage evaluation, furthermore the train speed <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math> and coefficient of friction <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math> are needed.</p>

<p>This means that for each longitudinal position of the wheel, these parameters can be evaluated and used to predict damage separately for the wing rail and the crossing nose. It therefore allows the identify critical regions in crossings.</p>

<p>To first show how this could work, existing damage criteria are used in this setup. The FEM model of one crossing nose is build up, load parameters are evaluated and then they are used to assess wear with a wear map, RCF with a shakedown map, and subsurface damage with the Dang-Van criterion.</p>

<p>Both RCF damage and subsurface damage can be evaluated based on<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>p</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p_0</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c</annotation></semantics></math>, only.

Then, the points along the longitudinal position along the wing rail and crossing nose can be plotted in the same diagram, indicating positions of damage.</p>

<p>closer look at damage mechanisms of the hadfield steel crossings @lv-2012 or manganese wing rails @dhar-2019</p>

<p></p>

<p>But what really happens on the scale of the material? What stands behind this shakedown maps and what does the small cyclic plastic deformation mean for wear and RCF? What are the physical mechanisms of crack development and wear, and how are they related to the cyclic contact loading? Can this be better understood, and can conclusions be drawn, which can contribute to developing better crossing materials? </p>

<p>This is addressed in the next chapter. Since these questions concern regular rails as much as crossing noses, and the load situation rails is much more simple than for crossings, it is studied for loads occurring in rails and rail material. However, the conclusions drawn can be mostly transferred to crossings.</p>
