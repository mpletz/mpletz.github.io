(this is for my own personal records, plz ignore)

----------------------

* a "unit test suite" page
* test on new page urls-with-?=...
* the "sentence follow-up" feature is a bit messed
	* no need for "..." after "recursive."
   * ":YouTube videos" should have pre-sentence

* In-built support for:
	* Wiktionary
	* Vimeo
	* Direct image links (if URL ends in .png, .jpeg, etc, embed that image)
	* Embed specific Wikipedia sections, not just the intro paragraph
	* Allow "before" and "after" texts for Wiki/YouTube
	* Can write full content of a very short Nutshell right in the link. (good for "hint systems")
	* A general "plug-in" system so that 1) I don't have a giant if-elseif-elseif statement for handling Wikipedia/YouTube/Vimeo/Wiktionary/Images/etc, and 2) other folks can write their own plug-ins.

* An "advanced features" demo page???

--------------------

AFTERWARDS
* no nut on blog headings in ncase, what's the deal? // blog's own fault: max-width: none; it works perfectly!
* confirm... NEW url for ?=
* Documentation: embed hover headers
* FEATURE: Hidden messages for lack of JS (RSS, Pocket) etc fallback
* FEATURE: Allow "before" and "after" texts for Wiki/YouTube
* FEATURE: Can write full content of a very short Nutshell right in the link. (good for "hint systems")
* Shorter than: You can embed this as an "expandable explanation" in your own blog/site! Click to preview
* Use "v". whoops.

> Itâ€™s common practice to prefix your version names with the letter v. Some good tag names might be v1.0.0 or v2.3.4.
